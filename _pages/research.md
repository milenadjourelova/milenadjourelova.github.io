- The Electoral Effects of Voting Technology: Evidence from Bulgaria

<details>
<summary>abstract</summary>
Can voting technology improve the integrity of elections in developing democracies? We study this question in the context of Bulgaria’s transition from paper ballots to voting via direct-recording electronic machines -- a measure introduced with the goals of improving the accuracy of the election process and disrupting established practices of vote-buying and voter coercion. Our empirical strategy leverages a sharp discontinuity in the rule for the allocation of voting machines across polling stations, and variation in the implementation of machine voting over nine consecutive elections. We document two main results. First, machine voting significantly increases the share of valid votes, effectively increasing the likelihood that votes -- especially those cast by less educated, elderly or ethnic minority voters -- are accurately counted toward the electoral outcome. Second, machine voting causes a large and significant reduction in turnout, particularly in poor and rural areas. Decomposing this decline, we find that it is driven entirely by a reduction in votes for parties that were locally dominant in general elections at baseline, while we find no change in votes for other parties.  We conduct representative surveys to further investigate mechanisms related to the reduction of bought or fictitious votes, as well as alternative mechanisms related to voters’ aversion to new technologies.
