### The Electoral Effects of Voting Technology: Evidence from Bulgaria
<details>
  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  Can voting technology improve the integrity of elections in developing democracies? We study this question in the context of Bulgaria’s transition from paper ballots to voting via direct-recording electronic machines -- a measure introduced with the goals of improving the accuracy of the election process and disrupting established practices of vote-buying and voter coercion. Our empirical strategy leverages a sharp discontinuity in the rule for the allocation of voting machines across polling stations, and variation in the implementation of machine voting over nine consecutive elections. We document two main results. First, machine voting significantly increases the share of valid votes, effectively increasing the likelihood that votes -- especially those cast by less educated, elderly or ethnic minority voters -- are accurately counted toward the electoral outcome. Second, machine voting causes a large and significant reduction in turnout, particularly in poor and rural areas. Decomposing this decline, we find that it is driven entirely by a reduction in votes for parties that were locally dominant in general elections at baseline, while we find no change in votes for other parties.  We conduct representative surveys to further investigate mechanisms related to the reduction of bought or fictitious votes, as well as alternative mechanisms related to voters’ aversion to new technologies.</details>

### In Their Shoes: Empathy through Information
<details>
  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  We explore the mechanics of empathy. We show that information about an outgroup can potentially activate and magnify empathy when presented in conjunction with an experience simulating their struggles. This response increases the willingness to help the struggling group, but it is only activated when the information comes before the experience and not after. We provide evidence for this effect in an immersive virtual reality experiment where participants (“witnesses”) simulate the struggle of unauthorized migrants (“protagonists”). These results are then replicated in a series of controlled lab experiments. We show that this effect operates through an increase in interpersonal similarity, or relatability. If information shifts perceptions of relatability, which changes people’s experience when witnessing the protagonist’s struggles, then it magnifies their empathetic response and drives them to engage in more prosocial behavior. Together, our evidence suggests that the ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person or group can be enhanced by activating empathy through simple information provision.
